# Edge AI Courses 

This repository provides a curated collection of Edge AI courses and resources for every engineer and practitioner of all levels.

### New to Edge AI? 

- Start with [Edge AI Engineering](https://github.com/afondiel/edge-ai-engineering): a practical guide covering core concepts of the entire [Edge AI MLOps](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/concepts/edge-ai-fundamentals/what-is-edge-mlops) stack with industry blueprints.
- Next, read ["The Next AI Frontier is at the Edge"](https://afondiel.github.io/posts/the-next-ai-frontier-is-at-the-edge/) to discover Edge AIâ€™s benefits and its rapidly evolving landscape.
- Edge AI is focused on solving real-world problems. Get started with these practical, real-world **edge-series**: [Edge Language (Coming Soon!)](https://github.com/afondiel/edge-audio), [Edge Audio](https://github.com/afondiel/edge-audio), [Edge Vision](https://github.com/afondiel/edge-vision)
